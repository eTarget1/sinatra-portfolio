Sinatra Portfolio Project
Objectives
Build a full scale Sinatra application that uses:
A sqlite database
ActiveRecord
RESTful routes
Sessions
Login/Logout

This is an Assurance Automobile using multiple objects that interact, including separate classes for User and assurence.

In purpose, a user should not be able to take any actions (except sign-up), unless they are logged in. Once a user is logged in, they should be able to create, edit and delete their own tweets, as well as view all the tweets.
